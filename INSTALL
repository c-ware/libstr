This library seeks to be portable to a large number of operating systems. For
this to happen, some operating systems require special compiler flags or
otherwise. This contains installation instructions for all operating systems
that libstring supports.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Make command (BSD Make, GNU Make, System V UNIX Make are all tested to work)
- Compiler that supports C89 minimum
- libc (I have to specify this, unfortunately)

Arch Linux Installation:
$ make
$ sudo make install

Debian 11.2.0 Installation:
Debian by default comes with no make or C compiler, so you will need to install
them.

$ sudo apt install gcc
$ sudo apt install make

Once those are installed,

$ make
$ sudo make install

Linux Mint Installation:
Linux mint has no libc installed by default (much to my disappointment), so it
will need to be installed. To do this, run:

$ sudo apt install libc6-dev

Once that is installed, run

$ make
$ sudo make install

OpenBSD, FreeBSD Installation (Run in a privileged mode):
$ make
$ make install

System V UNIX Installation (Run in a privileged mode):
$ make CC=gcc CFLAGS=-fpic
$ make install

Windows (Cygwin) Installation:
Requires the gcc-core and make packages.

$ make
$ make install
